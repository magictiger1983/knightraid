# knightraid
Base code for the website for Knight Raid, a FFXIV Free Company on Leviathan
I'm new to web development and chose Django for the framework for the website.
Please be patient as I try to get up to speed and understand what it is I'm doing here. :)

Done:<br />
Basic blog functionality<br />
Post editing/removal<br />
Basic authentication (only logged in users can edit or delete a post)<br />
DEBUG IS STILL ENABLED.  NOT PRODUCTION READY<br />
<br />
To-Do:<br />
User registration<br />
User approval<br />
Comments for posts<br />
Separate blog into officer posts and member posts<br />
Pretty up and standardize the CSS (main page list and details have different h1 styles)<br />
Only allow officers to delete posts, officers and author to edit<br />
<br />
Next Version:<br />
Calendar<br />
<br />
Down The Road:<br />
Track bad egg blacklisting (never reinvite people who caused problems)<br />
"I still need" tracker<br />
FC crafting tracker (airships, house goodies, etc)<br />
FC materials requester (I need X, Y and Z from airships)<br />
